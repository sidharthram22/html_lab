<h1>Tree data Structure</h1>
<p>
A tree in data structures is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure composed of a set of connected entities called nodes. Each node contains data and can have zero or more child nodes.
Key characteristics and terminology:

    Nodes and Edges: Nodes are the fundamental units storing data, while edges are the links connecting these nodes, representing relationships.

Root Node: The topmost node in a tree, from which all other nodes originate. It is the only node without a parent.
Parent and Child Nodes: A parent node is a node that has one or more child nodes connected to it. A child node is a node directly connected to and below a parent node.
Leaf Nodes: Nodes at the bottommost level of the tree that do not have any child nodes. 
Internal Nodes: Nodes that have at least one child node.
Siblings: Child nodes that share the same parent.
Subtree: A portion of a tree consisting of a node and all its descendants.
Depth of a Node: The number of edges from the root node to that specific node. 
Height of a Node: The number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf node in its subtree.
Height of a Tree: The height of the root node, representing the maximum depth of any node in the tree.

Why use trees?
Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships in data, such as: File systems in operating systems, Organization charts, Database indexes, and Syntax trees in compilers. 
They offer efficient methods for searching, insertion, and deletion of data compared to linear data structures, especially for large datasets.
